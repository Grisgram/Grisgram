As my main project, <a href="https://github.com/Grisgram/gml-raptor">gml-raptor</a>, grew stronger and stronger,<br/>me and three friends of mine, all highly skilled developers and designers, grouped together and we formed our company coldrock.games.<br/>
raptor is our key component in development and I want to invite you to give it a try!
</p>
<p align="center">
As a consequence of creating our own business, most of my personal repositories have been moved to the<br/><a href="https://github.com/coldrockgames">coldrock.games github organization</a><br/>
Please follow us there to see all our releases and update your bookmarks to the wikis, if you have some.

Personally, I develop and publish software under different labels, working as a developer since the 1980's.<br>You can reach me as <strong>@Grisgram</strong> on <a href="https://discord.gg/8krYCqr">GameMaker Kitchen Discord</a><br/>To support my work, please ‚≠ê the repositories you clone. The more reach the libraries geht, the better and faster they can evolve!
